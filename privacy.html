         <p><strong>Personal Data We Collect</strong></p>
          <p>We collect limited personal data from or about you or your devices, as described below. When you are asked to provide us with personal data you can generally decline. If you do not provide certain data, however, you may not be able to use our Services or you may have limited features available if that data is necessary to provide you with our Services or the features you wish to use.</p>
          <p> A. Information You Provide to Us.</p>
          <p>Registration and Profile Information. When you sign up for an account or use our Services, we will ask you for your name/username, age and email. You can also upload a profile photo.</p>
      <p>Content. In addition to uploading a profile photo, you can choose to post messages, share images, videos and other content through our Services.</p>
      <p>Communications. If you contact us directly, we may receive additional personal data about you. For example, when you contact us for support, we may receive your name, email address, phone number, and the contents of your support issue along with any other information you chose to provide.</p>
      <p> B. Personal Data We Collect When You Use our Services.</p>
      <p>Device Data. We collect data about the device and software you use to access our Services, including IP address, and general location (such as city, state, and country) inferred from IP address, operating system version, phone carrier and manufacturer, application installations, device identifiers, and push notification tokens. We use this data to provide and improve the Services.</p>
      <p>Usage Data. To help us understand how you use our Services and to help us improve them, we automatically receive data about how you use our Services, like the pages or other content you view, the data you upload, how much time you spend on a page, objects such as hyperlinks you click on, and the dates and times of your visits.</p>
      <p><strong>How We Use the Personal Data We Collect</strong></p>
      <p>We use the personal data described above:</p>
      <p>To provide, maintain, improve, and enhance our Services, including, to deliver
      your messages and content and to help you find and connect with people you know
      who use the Service or who you wish to invite to connect on our Services;</p>
      <p>To understand and analyze how you use our Services and develop new products,
      services, features, and functionality;</p>
      <p>To communicate with you, such as through push notifications and in app
      messaging, to provide you with updates and other information relating to our
      Services, such as new features you may wish to use in our Services, provide
      information that you request, respond to requests, comments, and questions, and
      otherwise provide customer support;</p>
      <p>To generate de-identified or aggregated data for our business purposes;</p>
      <p>To find and prevent fraud and illegal acts, and respond to trust and safety
      issues;</p>
      <p>For compliance purposes, including enforcing our Terms of Service or other legal
      rights, as may be required by applicable laws and regulations, or as requested
      by any judicial process or governmental agency; and</p>
      <p>For other purposes for which we provide specific notice at the time your
      personal data is collected.</p>
      <p><strong>How We Share Your Personal Data</strong></p>
      <p><em>We do not sell your personal data.</em> We also design our Services so that we do not
      share or otherwise disclose personal data we collect from or about you in ways
      you would not expect. We share each of the categories of personal data described
      above with the following third parties for the business purposes described (or
      otherwise disclosed to you at the time of the collection):</p>
      <p><em>Service Providers.</em> We may share personal data we get with service providers
      who help us provide our Services.  Service Providers may also collect or provide
      data on our behalf in connection with our Services.</p>
      <p><em>Your Connections.</em> Your Connections. Our Services are social services in which you can view and share content. Your name/username and profile information will be viewable by other users. The content you share on the Services will be viewable by other users to whom you have allowed to view such content. In the “Your Choices” section of this Privacy Notice, we describe the controls that you can use, along with other relevant settings associated with your account, to limit the sharing of certain data. We are not responsible for other users’ use of your content and personal data once you decide to share. You should be careful about whether and what to share and how you wish to identify yourself on the Services.
            </p>
      <p><em>As Required by Law and Similar Disclosures.</em> We may access, preserve, and
      disclose your personal data if we believe doing so is required or appropriate
      to:
      (a) comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a
      court order or subpoena;
      (b) respond to your requests; or
      (c) protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, security, or safety,
      including enforcing our terms and policies. For the avoidance of doubt, the
      disclosure of your information may occur if you send any objectionable content
      on or through our Services.</p>
      <p><em>Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers.</em> We may transfer your personal data to
      service providers, advisors, potential transactional partners, or other third
      parties in connection with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a
      corporate transaction or proceeding in which we are acquired by or merged with
      another company or we sell, liquidate, or transfer all or a portion of our
      business or assets.</p>
      <p><em>With Your Consent.</em> We may also disclose your personal data with your
      permission or direction.</p>
      <p><strong>Your Choices</strong></p>
      <p><em>Access, Deletion, and Correction.</em></p>
      <p> You can also request to
      access, delete, and correct your personal data by emailing us at
      <a href="mailto:info@sruper.com">info@sruper.com</a>.</p>
      <p><em>Sharing Preferences.</em></p>
      <p>We provide you with settings to let you decide how you connect with others and
      share content. Certain information are always publicly available to others, for
      example, if you comment on the post of a friend, their friends can see your
      comments, and other information is made publicly available to others by default.
      To change whether certain information is publicly viewable, you can adjust the
      settings in your account.</p>
      <p><em>Do Not Track.</em></p>
      <p>We do not track your online activities over time and across third-party website
      and online services through our Services. We also do not let third parties do
      this on our Services. So, we have no need to respond to Do Not Track signals,
      and we do not respond to such signals.</p>
      <p><strong>Location Data </strong></p>
      <p> The location data is updated in realtime and only shared with people you choose. You always have the choice not to share it with anyone but location access is integral for using some of the Sruper Services. For more information please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@sruper.com">info@sruper.com</a>.</p>.</p>
      <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
      <p>We make reasonable and appropriate steps to protect personal data from
      unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, and destruction by using
      physical and electronic safeguards designed to improve the security of the
      personal data. However, as no electronic transmission or storage of information
      can be entirely secure, we can make no guarantees as to the security or privacy
      of your information.</p>
      <p><strong>International Visitors</strong></p>
      <p>Our Services are hosted in the United States. If you choose to use our Services
      from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data
      collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are
      transferring your personal data outside of those regions to the United States
      for storage and processing.</p>
      <p>Also, we may transfer your personal data from the U.S. to other countries or
      regions in connection with storage and processing of personal data. By providing
      personal data, on or to our Services, you consent to such transfer, storage, and
      processing. We take steps designed to ensure that the personal data we collect
      under this statement is processed and protected according to the provisions of
      this Privacy Notice and applicable law wherever the data is located.</p>
      <p><strong>EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS</strong></p>
      <p>If the processing of personal data about you is subject to European Union data
      protection law and similar laws, you have certain rights with respect to that
      data:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>You can request access to, and rectification or erasure of, personal data;</li>
      <li>If any automated processing of personal data is based on your consent or a
      contract with you, you have a right to transfer or receive a copy of the
      personal data in a usable and portable format;</li>
      <li>If processing of personal data is based on your consent, you can withdraw
      consent at any time for future processing;</li>
      <li>You can to object to, or restrict, the processing of personal data under
      certain circumstances; and</li>
      <li>For residents of France, you can send us specific instructions regarding use
      of your data after your death.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To make such requests or contact our Data Protection Officer, please use the
      contact information at the bottom of this statement. You also have the right to
      lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, but we encourage you to first
      contact us with any questions or concerns.</p>
      <p>We rely on different lawful bases for collecting and processing personal data
      about you, for example, with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the
      services you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal
      obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfil
      other legitimate interests.</p>
      <p><strong>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></p>
      <p>If you are a California resident and the processing of personal data about you
      is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), you have certain
      rights with respect to that information as described below.</p>
      <p><strong>Right to Know.</strong> You have a right to request that we disclose to you the
      personal data we have collected about you. You also have a right to request
      additional information about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale of such
      personal data. You may also make
      a “request to know” by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@sruper.com">info@sruper.com</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Right to Request Deletion.</strong> You also have a right to request that we delete
      personal data under certain circumstances, subject to certain exceptions. You
      can delete all your personal data from our servers and your device by deleting
      your account using app settings. You may also make a
      request to delete by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@sruper.com">info@sruper.com</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Right to Opt-Out.</strong> You have a right to opt-out from future “sales” of
      personal data. We do not sell or intend to sell personal data of anyone and have
      not done so in the past 12 months or ever. You may designate, in writing or
      through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf
      to exercise your rights under the CCPA. Before accepting such a request from an
      agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act
      on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.
      Further, to provide or delete specific pieces of personal data other than
      through the settings in our app we must verify your identity as required by law.
      We do this by having you provide information or take certain action.  Finally,
      you have a right to receive notice of our privacy practices at or before we
      collect personal data, and you have a right to not be discriminated against for
      exercising CCPA rights.</p>
      <p>Additionally, under California Civil Code section 1798.83, the “Shine the Light”
      law, California residents who have provided personal data to a business with
      which the individual has established a business relationship for personal,
      family, or household purposes (“California Customers”) may request information
      about whether the business has disclosed personal data to any third parties for
      the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose personal data
      to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes as defined by this law.
      California Customers may request further information about our compliance with
      this law by e-mailing <a href="mailto:info@sruper.com">info@sruper.com</a>. Please note that businesses are
      required to respond to one request per California Customer each year and may not
      be required to respond to requests other than through the designated e-mail
      address.</p>
      <p>California residents under the age of 18 who are registered users of online
      sites, services, or applications have a right to remove, or request and obtain
      removal of, content or information they have publicly posted.  To request that we remove
      content or information, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@sruper.com">info@sruper.com</a>. Please be
      aware that your request does not guarantee complete or comprehensive removal of
      content or information posted online and that the law may not permit or require
      removal in certain circumstances.</p>
      <p><strong>Retention of Personal Data</strong></p>
      <p>We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the services and
      fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations,
      resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate and lawful
      business purposes. Because these needs are different for different data types
      and for different purposes, actual retention periods can vary significantly
      based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the
      data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data,
      and our legal or contractual obligations.</p>

      <p><strong>Update Your Information or Pose a Question</strong></p>
      <p>You can update your account and profile information through your profile
      settings. If you have questions about your privacy on our Services or this
      Privacy Notice, please contact us at  <a href="mailto:info@sruper.com">info@sruper.com</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Notice</strong></p>
      <p>When we post changes to this Privacy Notice, we will revise the “Last Updated”
      date at the top of the page. If we materially change the ways in which we use
      personal data previously collected from you through our Services, we will notify
      you and/or obtain consent for those changes as applicable law requires.</p>
      <p><strong>Contact Information</strong></p>

      activities, please email us at <a href="mailto:info@sruper.com">info@sruper.com</a> or write to us at
